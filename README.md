# Skillfield Mentor-Projects

As part of the Skillfield Mentor Projects program, I worked on real-time data analytics and machine learning projects under expert guidance. These projects focused on health data analysis and predictive modeling.

ðŸ”¹ Projects:

1) Diabetes Prediction â€“ Built a classification model to identify individuals at risk of diabetes.
2) Glucose Level Prediction â€“ Applied regression techniques to estimate glucose levels from health indicators.
3) Heart Rate Prediction â€“ Used logistic regression on the Framingham dataset to predict heart disease risk.

ðŸ”¹ Skills Gained:

* ðŸ§¹ Data Preprocessing & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* ðŸ“ˆ Logistic & Linear Regression for prediction tasks

* ðŸ“Š Model Evaluation using Accuracy Score & Confusion Matrix

* ðŸŽ¨ Visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn for insight presentation
